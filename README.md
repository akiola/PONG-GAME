# PONG-GAME

This is a Pong Game I created using python turtle as the primary tool.
I used Object Oriented Programming to organize the components to enable easy debugging and in order to add more features in the future. 
To play this game, you need to clone this repository and install the turtle library. 
The game logic runs in main.py
